Version 1.1 - January 19, 2011
 - Bug fix: if widget was disabled by default, the buttons were not also disabled by default.
 - Bug fix: buttons would not loose focus tabbing away from the widget.
 - Bug fix: changing the input value did not raise the change event of the input when using the buttons or arrow keys.
 - Updated: widget to use ui-widget-content so that a border doesn't have to be explicitly set in the ui-numeric CSS
   class.
 - Updated: the ui-numeric-buttons class to use the EM unit for the button width and height.
 - Added: version property.
 - Added: settings to specify the up/down button icons and tooltip text.
 - Added: setting to specify tooltip text for when hovering over the input.
 - Added: widget now destroys itself on page unload to help prevent memory leaks.

   padDecimals(), getOrdinal(), format(), and formatCurrency().

Version 1.2 - January 28, 2011
 - Bug fix: Issue #1 - After changing the input value by typing in a new value, the old value would be used when
   incrementing/decrementing using the arrow keys if the input had not lost focus. See
   https://github.com/flamewave/jquery-ui-numeric/issues#issue/1 for details.
 - Added: "calc" setting that allows a custom function to be used to increment/decrement the value.
 - Added: Moved the functionality for adding the buttons to the widget to their own function so that plugin authors
   can more easily override the placement of the buttons.

 - Cleanup: Removed un-used "blur" event handler that was left over from fixing a previous issue.

   properly format the number.
 - Bug fix: In CSS to fully support the HTML5 "number" input type.
 - Added: $.keyCodeToCharCode() method that is used as part of the fix for issue #4.

   information.

Version 1.4.1 - September 1, 2011
